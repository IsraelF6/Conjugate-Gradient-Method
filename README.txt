Solve Ax = b using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. 
The preconditioner is Jacobi “polynomial preconditioning” of order p = 0, 1, . . .. 
Your program should make it easy for one to specify the size of the matrix system, tolerance, method, and p. 
For the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, use the algorithm from Jonathan Shewchuk’s notes
“introduction to the conjugate gradient method without the agonizing
pain” (posted on blackboard) page 51.
