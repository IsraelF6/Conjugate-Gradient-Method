# Conjugate-Gradient-Method

Solve Ax = b using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method using the algorithm from Jonathan 
Shewchuk’s notes “introduction to the conjugate gradient method without the agonizing pain” page 51.
The preconditioner is Jacobi “polynomial preconditioning” of order p = 0, 1, ... 
Your program should make it easy for one to specify the size of the matrix system, tolerance, method, and p.
